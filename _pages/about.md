**I am a postdoctoral researchers studying clownfish metamorphosis.** I focus on the early (post-embryonic) development of clownfish digestive tract and on the role of thyroid hormones in this process.  I work in [Vincent Laudet's lab](https://groups.oist.jp/meedu) at Academia Sinica's Marine Research Station ([]中央研究院所臨海研究站](https://sl.icob.sinica.edu.tw/mrs/)), Yilan County, Taiwan.  My main academic interests reside in endoderm and gut tube development.

<br/><br/>
My PhD was in biotechnology and bioengineering, and also focused on endoderm developmental biology, but in the context of the mammalian embryo. I have expertise in stem cell biology, mouse developmental biology, and endoderm developmental biology. I have also experience in synthetic embryology and bioengineering. I am an advocate for intersectional open science, preprints, equitable publishing, and knowledge equity. Aside from my work, I am interested in data communication and visual storytelling in developmental biology.

I have been a volunteer contributor for [preLights](https://prelights.biologists.com/about-us/) with Paul Gerald Layague Sanchez, my boyfriend, and I am a signatory of [DORA](https://sfdora.org/read/). I also used to curate a list of Global South-authored preprints on the eLife platform [Sciety](https://sciety.org/users/ZonaPellucida_/lists/saved-articles).
