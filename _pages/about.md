I am a PhD student with experience in stem cell and mouse developmental biology and expertise in embryonic stem cell culture, synthetic embryology, and bioengineering. My main academic interests reside in endoderm and gut tube development, as well as mechanobiology and mechanical inputs to development. I am an advocate for open science, preprints, and equitable publishing. Aside from my research projects, I am interested in data communication and visual storytelling in developmental biology. I resonate with knowledge equity movements of embodied knowledge and pedagogy.

## Current research

In humans, mice, and other mammals key internal organs such as the gut, lungs, pancreas, liver, thyroid, thymus, and bladder (and many others!) all derive from the same embryonic tissue: the endoderm. The development of all of these structures thus depends on a same set of early cells, and on the developmental instructions provided to them by the embryo. To study what these instructions might be, I am currently investigating the modes of development that endoderm cells (and their progenitors) execute when they can **not** rely on them. That is, when they are made to self-organise **in vitro** in a dish in the lab. Even on their own, endoderm cells emerge with timings and patterns comparable to what happens when they are on the embryo, and eventually form patterned structures in many way similar to the embryonic gut tube. My research touches on topics of endoderm and epithelial identity, self-organisation, patterning, and fundamental mammalian developmental biology.
