I have found my scientific practice to be most at ease when developing through the visual medium, both as I approach new topics and concepts, and as I contribute in turn to the communications of new findings. Be they diagrams, digital illustrations, microscopy pictures, volumes, colors, textures, I found that it is through visual media and graphic exploration that I most easily carve out spaces of deeper introspection on my scientific work (and my academic path at large). And this not only in terms of scientific visualisation of raw data, or in terms of usefulness of the visual in scientific storytelling and accessibility, but also for the value of the illustration process itself as a means of understanding ("Drawing as a way of Knowing", Anderson 2017). In my own practice (i.e. within the context of mouse Developmental Biology), I have explored and elaborated on these themes with a focus on the use of 2.5D and 3D volumetric data as a tool to foster visual-spatial literacy and penetrative thinking skills in the field (see [my work on this topic](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.23.393991v1)). Still, and given the interdisciplinary and heterogeneous nature of my lab, I have also come to illustrate a variety of other topics. These works have made the pages of several pieces of literature in a variety of fields, yet never existed in a collected, easy to find place.

This page wants to be some form of digital scrapbook where all these illustrations may find a home.

### Bone marrow organoids (3D render, 2021)

This work was commissioned by Sonja Giger, a former PhD student in the lab, which needed figures to illustrate her organoid research. Sonja generates human bone marrow organoids by aggregation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (beige), and then incorporates Endothelial Cells (purple) within them to mimic the vascular compartment of the bone marrow niche. Over time, these endothelial cells come together to form a branched network throughout the organoid. These aggregates can then be used e.g. as an assay for the homing capacity of healthy or diseased blood cells (red), which she would then find within the core of the organoids.

The illustration process was mainly done on Blender, and combines 3D modelled structures (cells and aggregates, multiwell plate, etc..) with real-world data collected by Sonja. Indeed, the 3D model of the endothelial network that forms over time (purple network in the figures), comes directly from volume microscopy data collected from real organoids. The composition of  floating cells and cell aggregates was instead generated by a combination of particle emitter, flow constraints, and gravity attractors from scratch.
